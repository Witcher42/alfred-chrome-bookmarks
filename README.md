### Download

You can download the workflow from [here](https://github.com/Witcher42/alfred-chrome-bookmarks/raw/master/zip/chrome-bookmarks.alfredworkflow).


### Introduction

Requirements: Python 2.7.x or above.

This workflow helps you search Google Chrome bookmarks by using a ```chrome``` (Google Chrome) or ```chromium``` (Chromium) keyword:

**[New]** This project supports simple fuzzy match, so you can use many keywords to search your bookmarks. <small>I don't use chromium, add it yourself as you like.</small>

Also you can specify which profile will be used by using a ```chrome-profiles``` (Google Chrome) or ```chromium-profiles``` (Chromium) keyword:

### Improvement

This project is forked from [mdreizin/alfred-workflows](https://github.com/mdreizin/alfred-workflows). And I made some improvements as I like.

* simple fuzzy match
    
    Search the key word one by one, instead of searching the whole sentence. This can improve much experience.
    
* word relevancy sorting

    sort using the score of a bookmark's word relevancy
