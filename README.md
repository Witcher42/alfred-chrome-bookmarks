Workflows for Alfred 2


Chrome Bookmarks
----------------

### Improvement

This project is forked from [mdreizin/alfred-workflows](https://github.com/mdreizin/alfred-workflows). And I made some improvements as I like.

* simple fuzzy match
    
    Search the key word one by one, instead of searching the whole sentence. This can improve much experience.

### Introduction

Requirements: Python 2.7.x or above.

This workflow helps you search Google Chrome bookmarks by using a ```chrome``` (Google Chrome) or ```chromium``` (Chromium) keyword:

Also you can specify which profile will be used by using a ```chrome-profiles``` (Google Chrome) or ```chromium-profiles``` (Chromium) keyword:
